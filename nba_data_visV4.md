### Live and Die by the Three 

The first thing that we should explore as a NBA team looking to have a succesful season in the modern era is to see the increased number of 3 point shots. How the NBA team according to many news articles has evolved into a spacing oriented and 3 point focused game during the regular season.  

* [3 Point Revolution]{https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/whats-the-end-game-for-nbas-3-point-revolution-coaches-and-players-sound-off-on-the-games-most-dominant-shot/}
* [More 3's the Better]{https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900019954/why-the-3-point-shot-has-become-too-much-of-a-good-thing.html}
* [Warriors and the 3's]{https://sports.yahoo.com/warriors-fall-behind-nba-3-172136589.html}

Let us first look at the distrubtion of the 3 point shot made, 2 point shot made and salary. 


```
##   median(salary) mean(salary) sd(salary)    var(salary) IQR(salary)
## 1        2678400      4523495    4862128 23640286672352     4899590
```

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->


There seems to be a right skew in the data.  Showing that superstars and stars get the biggest pay day and take the biggest proportion of the teams salary.  


```
##   median(two) mean(two)  sd(two) var(two) IQR(two)
## 1         2.1  2.667674 1.899015  3.60626      2.5
```

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

```
##   median(three) mean(three) sd(three) var(three) IQR(three)
## 1           0.3   0.5867761 0.6674279  0.4454601          1
```

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png)<!-- -->

Both are right skewed showing that the stars and main players on the team usually take most of the shots.  

Lets now look at the trend over the years of the three point shot vs two point shot.

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

The mean 3 point shots have been increasing indicated by the trending upward blue dots. While the number of 2 point shots have been decreasing by the red dots going down.  


![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

For players who took more than three 3's a game there is an increase in salary after the 2015 year.  However, there is still a decrease before then.  Perhaps teams didn't pay big salaries for 3 point specialist earlier on and emphasized on other basketball statistics. 

Let us explore if 3 pointers lead to more wins

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

2014 seems to be an increase in wins for taking more than three 3's a game.  Before that the league was more big man focused with players such as Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'neal, Jermaine O'neal, Dwight Howard.  

Now let us explore the other end of the spectrum. With less than three 3's a game. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

There is still an increase in salary.  This is due to the TV contract money with the NBA increasing the salary cap which was a huge factor. However, if you look at the summary of the mins and max you can see taking more than 3 threes a game is beneficial. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

Attemping more 3's is benefical it looks like.  From the years 2004 to 2008 the league still had traditional big men who dominated the league.  Spacing and rules didn't emphasize spacing as much. Having players that take less than three 3's a game leads to a team win that would be 8th seed in the east and out of the playoffs in the western conference.  

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

Making more two's of course leads to a better salary. The TV money seems have a major factor to increase the salary for the players after 2015. 

Conclusion:

Overall 3 point shooting does lead to more wins and an increase of salary.  However, due to the TV contract there was a huge salary bump as well as new CBA and talks with the players association. 

### PPG vs EFG

With the increased reliance on data interpretation what we want to explore is the rise of EFG vs PPG. Players like Rudy Gay and Josh Smith who scored in bunches before used to be rewarded huge contracts.  However, it was later found they scored inefficiently.  

$$ EFG = (FG + 0.5 * 3P) / FGA. $$

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

Salary over the years has increased.  But there doesn't seem to be a clear relationship with points per game over the years and salary. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

EFG seems to be trending in the later years.  As more GMs and teams look at data they are paying more for players who are shooting more effectively.  In the past teams perhaps were only looking at points per game. 



Lets look at a 20 ppg scorer vs a 50 percent EFG players and see how their salaries compare.

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

Lets look at over 51 percent EFG

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

Early on EFG didn't seem to take notice to teams as much,  but as we entered the 2014 year and above this statisic became more relevant 

###Which schools in the US are teams spending their salary the most for salary.

Exploring this data could give us information on where to look to draft a NBA prospect for a NBA team.

```

249 schools (no school included for internationals if they played professionally outside the USA)


Lets look at the top 10 schools that got paid


```

```

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

Should be always looking at these schools for prospects looking at the total salary paid.  Seems to have best basketball programs

Lets take a look at the data that was accounted for by college programs




Looking at the notable names Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, Dwight Howard, Jermaine O'neal that would be 5 out of 430 highschoolers who made it to superstar level.  That's 1.2 percent chance. 


Out of Country Prospects for teams to spend their salary on.


![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

Looking at the top salaries would want to look into these countries in terms if finding talent or drafting in the future or free agents.


###How important is getting the number 1 pick by either saving salary by tanking or being unlucky 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

Now lets compare to being a relatively good team but paying for good scouts to draft or look abroad in the second round. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see that by not selecting the number one pick overall it yielded 4 more defensive players or nba team selections.  But we have to keep in mind other picks in the first round.  Other notable picks that aren't first rounders include Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, A'mare Stoudamire.

###The Best vs the Worst

Lets look at the data for the winning team and team that lost the most for each year 2000 to 2018
![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)<!-- -->![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-2.png)<!-- -->

Winning teams tend to spend over the cap while losing teams spend under or stay below the salary cap for each year.


Lets look at the Top teams each year vs Worst teams each year

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)<!-- -->![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-2.png)<!-- -->![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-3.png)<!-- -->

We can see the top teams spend the most money each year.  Their best players also recieve the more money than the worst teams player. Looking at the average salary the best teams spend much more than the worst. 

### Most successful teams in the last 19 years.  

Looking at the team that spent the most over and the team that spent the least.

Looking at the winningest team vs the team that lost the most in the last 19 years. 

The team that won the most is the 2016 GSW and the team with the fewest wins was the 2012 Charlotte Bobcats.  The team that spent the most over the salary cap was the 2018 Cleveland Caviliers.  The team that spent the least over the salary cap was the 2000 LA clippers.

You can see Michael Jordan didn't really spend that much money on his bobcats to have them winning. 


Comparing the worst vs the best team side by side

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)<!-- -->

The GSW looked as if they spent double the amount.  But also have to include the salary cap increase.  Teams with winning players will spend more over the cap than teams who can't win.  The real question is do teams spend just enough to stay in cap and then just tank to get draft picks and then players?

The Clippers drafted well with Blake Griffin however there were many injuries.  So tanking to get a star was worth it.  They also got Eric Gordon and Lamar Odom who both woth 6th man of the year.

Comparing them with the Cavs.  We can see the Cavs spent money to keep their team intact for their Finals run.

Above is the chart of taking all the players and averaging them all out to create Mr. Avg Joe.  Now lets compare him to differnt categories of NBA players. 

### Average Joe vs Superstar, Star and Roleplayer

SuperStars

Looking at the life cycle of a NBA player we can determine a salary reference point of how to pay them.


![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png)<!-- -->

Duncan salary and production is above the average player.  Late in his career he took pay cuts which brought his salary down. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png)<!-- -->

Kobe commanded a much higher salary than the avg Joe.  He also did not take a decrease in salary for the later years.  However his minutes per game did not go down.  It might be interesting to do an analysis on his achillies injury and overuse of his body in future analysis. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)<!-- -->

Lebron salary has kept going up.  His body has not slowed down either.  The amount of minutes played has not really decreased at all.  Seems like a player anomally.  

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png)<!-- -->

Garnett seems to have taken a few paycuts for the Timberwolves to get him better players.  Production did go down a lot.  Perhaps bigmen have smaller life cycles than smaller players. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png)<!-- -->

Dirk took pay cuts as well.  His production also started to decrease.  It would be interesting to compare height and player life cycle. 

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png)<!-- -->

Taller players that make it past year 10 seem to have a longer life cycle.  

**Stars**

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png)<!-- -->

Vince Carters Life cycle goes up in years where it reaches its peak in his 30s then begins to decrease. Pay goes up because of new contract deals for NBA players increasing the overall salary cap.

![](nba_data_visV4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png)<!-- -->

Manu had a decrease in salary pay as he passed 35.  But as soon as the contract money got signed the new TV deal he got paid due to an increase in salary cap overall.

To see if a team could possibily sign a player went with 25 percent over and under the mid level exception everyyear.  Also, did not want to have a player drafted that year as well as no player under 23 for that year.

These are notable mid level exception players that fell into the category.  Except for Damian Lilard and Klay most of these players could have possibly be signed to a mid level exception if they were free agents due to bad team management.

Mid level player used to get paid more but probably because of the previous CBA and building superteams they cut the amount so good maxed out teams cannot sign a good player with a huge mid level exception salary.
