##NBA player stats against NBA player salaries

######By Justin Huang



**1.	What is the problem you want to solve?**

* Do NBA players statistics always match up with their salaries.  Does scoring more points, grabbing more rebounds having better advanced statistics always land a player a better contract?  What other external factors might go into an NBA contract.  I¡¯ll be exploring 20 years of NBA player data from the 2000 regular season to the current regular season. 

* How much do other factors determine the players contract market:
  
    + A player playing for his next contract	
    + How deep the free agency market is
    + Player popularity in media
    + Small market vs big market teams
    + Did that player just have one good playoff series
    + Player is injury prone

**2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn¡¯t have otherwise?**

*Clients will be NBA analysts, general managers, scouts or even NBA players who will be trying to evaluate NBA salaries.  They would use this as a reference point when starting salary negotiations.  


**3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?**


* The data will be acquired from basketball reference, a sit that contains NBA current and historical statistics.  

* https://www.basketball-reference.com/

* Data for player statistics can be easily obtained through csv files they provide for the regular seasons of 2000-2019.

* NBA player salaries will have to be obtained using rvest since salaries are hidden within individual player pages on basketball reference. 

**4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).**


* Will have to run a multiple linear regression model that will explore different variables of an NBA player plotted against their salary. 

* Such variables would include:

    + Made an all-star team
    + Team made the playoffs
    + Points, rebounds, steals, assists
    + NBA Player efficiency rating
    + Offensive and defensive on/off ratings
    + Final contract year
    + Injured during regular season 
    + Individual performances (all nba, defensive team, MVP etc¡­) 

**5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.**

* The deliverables will be an R script code containing the code used for data wrangling, data exploration and regression model.

* The paper will be data story and visualization of NBA data against NBA salaries exploring other external factors explaining decreases or increases in NBA player salary.

* A slide deck power point presentation that will conclude the findings.
