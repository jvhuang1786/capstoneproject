#Blaines code  
#rookie_1_team %>% mutate(year = lookup_table[match(row_number(), lookup_table$row), "year"])
#where %>% and mutate are from dplyr, match is a base R function which finds the location of the first argument in the vector of the second argument, 
#then returns the value in the given column.  This is very much like a vlookup in Excel if you have ever used that.  
#The row_number is also a dplyr function, and as we are sending your data.frame (rookie_1_team) into the piple (the %>% is the pipe operator), 
#row_number() automatically applies to the data.frame.  
#So this matches row numbers of your data frame to the row column of the lookup table and returns the year column and puts it into the new column year in your data.frame.  
#You can look up the syntax of all these.
